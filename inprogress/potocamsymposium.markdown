Only about 25 people here, 10% full auditorium

Alan Leshner - Greeting (Big Data Affinity Group)
-------------------------------------------------

Brain institute goal from long ago: make all neurosci data stored and sharable
met with lots of friction by neuroscience
but got a lot of grants to do it,
made sharable formats, even if data itself isn't stored and shared.

Don't just have interesting and provocative convo - there's money and politicians around interested in sharable data - 


Michael S.
---------
Information extremely valuable - changes the world, etc.
That's a problem, b/c people want to own, protect, milk the value out of their info.
But most of info's value is wasted if it's locked away.

goals for today: what laws and discussions w/ lawmakers are going to help speed up data sharing.


Panel 1
-------

Data sharing opportunities and challenges. Jerry Sheehan introducing.

Introing Marcia McNutt - editor in chief of Science.  US Geo Survey director previously
.
Yuan Liu - 

Nina Preuss - NITRIC

Paul Albert - biostatistician

MM: (15 min intro)
-Some challenges,
-places to look for inspiration
-Science policy NOW is that all data needed to come to the conclusion in the paper must be made available
-Editors' meeting: "Who should hold the data - who hosts the repos?"
-Science urges scientists to use their own repositories, community repos, instead of a centralized one at Science, a Science repo would starve the public repos
-e.g. - lots of authors from google and uni reanalized LANSAT data, found that Brazillian deforestation efforts were completely offset by Indonesia's lax policy
 If Science insisted that LANSAT archive were hosted by Science... impossible.  It's already backed up several times in some other repo.

-How about tissue samples, biological samples - no good archives established. Science requires that the PI's hold those.
-Science doesn't allow 1 year Dryad embargo; other journals allow Dryad data to stay private for a year after publication

-Africa encouraging its scientist to hold their data Longer, to give an advantage.
-Science hasn't encountered an African scientist that tests that policy yet

-Privacy (phone record virus spread data) - data can't be released broadly, but released to individuals who promise to keep the same sharign policy

-4 guidelines for transparency and reproducibility
--How will outliers be treated, when will study end: pre planning
--Power analysis
--Random assignment into treatment/control groups
--Experimenter blinding

- Press release of a Nature paper got pulled back last minute because the 4 guidelines weren't met

data sharing challenges, opportunities, solutions (slides)
why / what (raw not enough - imposible) / how / when / with whom to share
 
challenges:
sociological: people want to keep their hard-earned data
fear of naive users misusing, abusing the data
technological challenges
practical financial challenges

Why to share:
How to address reluctance: stick, carrot, or both

stick: for >500k grants you need a data sharing plan, but it's not considered when assigning scores
stronger stick: genomic data sharing polic (RFI) 

carrot: many datasets have way more info than one lab could analize.
more questions could be answered than you thought of originally
cost-effective to share data

more carrot: whyme and reason of data sharing: five success stories demonstrating value-adding on shared data
use of data from outsiders - like economist using fMRI (who didn't cite original author, but original author didn't care)

Needs in policy:
Rewarding the contributers
policy for acknowledging use

OSTP (white house) promoted open data (get name recognition for open data)

Policy on sharing should be part of tenure and promotion decisions. (demand uni's do it?)

Merit awards, some scoring could come from data-sharing track-record


HOW to share:
Establish sharing platform and environment
INCF - International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility
Neuroscience INformation Farmework (NIF)
Neuroimaging INformatics Tools and Resources Clearinghouse (NITRC) (Nina Preuss)

Need common daat elelents to consolidate data types

KEY is community buy-in


When to share:


With whom to share:
collabs (of course)
future collabs
known users
unknown users - so many unknown users - how do we prevent misuse?  
                How to control trafic? How to acknowledge?


Practical challenges
Lack of training

opportunities (BD2k) Big data to knowledge

CRCNS data sharing website.

How to support storage fees?

Ending slogan: Data Sharing and Data Mining Lead to New Discoveries (from communist china haha)


NP

NITRC as a case study, adress Liu's three challenges

650 programs hosted there.

NITRC computation environment - kind of big data platform - neurodebian?

NITRC class in school - kids push data to cloud, preprocess, download, finish up research

Tech issues:
bring data to compute (cloud?)
-transfer over network
-have hard drives shipped to you
-NITRC on AWS

NITRIC won't charge for data download, or mark-up AWS time, b/c they're still trying to popularize


PA (Paul Albert)
--

Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Branch of Eunice Eknnedy Shriver National institute of child health an human development

Why share data?
reproduce findings of others
individualize meta-analysis

goals of reproducability
- reconstruct both data 
 -raw
 -normalized
 -user-derived variables
 -methods for published papers
reconstruct complex stats analyses clearly, concisely

one stats journal has 'reproducability review' - editor tries to reproduce, if success, paper gets a "Reproduced" stamp

Avoid proprietary software

In-paper code-to-figure tech in R.


Challenges with sharing image data



Questions from Jerry Sheehan

what's the next big opportunity in neurosci datasharing?

YL: most important roadblock is community buy-in.  No amount of platforming will be useful w/out social change.
Metadata format - without that, we can't share.  Neuroimaging is ripe for sharing.  only 4 or 5 analysis packages


Open science framework.


MM: optogenetics: high spatial high temporal resolution means lots of data.
YL: federated databases, also for optogenetics, not sigle-controlled ones


Question: how to you quality-control the data?
MM: there was a study on repeatability of poor/good data qualitiy within RESEARCHER across time.

Jerry Q:
What's the emaning of having mulitple stakeholders here? (journal editor, neuroscientist, private industry person, statistician)

PA: new methods need to be accessable and reproducable.  not just data, but also the analytic tools. peer review it, compare them to each other, user-friendly reconfiguration.

NP: Industry and academia need to be part of the culture change. big data now will be small data in 5-10 years.

YL: More than two ways of working together.  Funders can fund tool developers.  Communication. neuroscientist work together with journal editor to make optogenetics repo?

MM: Journal <-> community rln is a dance.  Sometimes journal leads, sometimes community leads.  But we all have to agree on the dance (tange? walz? etc).  So community has to decide it's a willing partner.  Science says that journals are ready to be the conveners.


Georgio Ascolli talk

Lots of neurons in db. site not open-source, but 3d vis program is?

If people want to share their data, they send a zip, georgio annotates and uploads, and sharer's name goes on a list.

If people don't want to share, their name goes on a different list!


Panel 2:
Building the road forward

Rita Colwell
------------

intro, 'nothing happening in this panel is new'
Doing 'Numerical taxonomy' since the early 80's!

different concentrations of different bacteria in gut of US healthy and INdian healthy folks.
Indians have more parasites and more yogurty bacteria.

presentations today very nice, but we're poised to do a lot more

Michael Huerta
--------------

making biomed research more datacentric

biomed research has not created data, they've created Concepts,
and that's the most fragile part of the whole proces

tomorrow it should be datacentric, by making it
- shared
- standardized
- brought to sci ecosystem
- enabling
- fancy plot

today  ====BD2K====> tomorrow

under NIH advisory committee

BD2K is a funding program - funding, grants, hiring postdocs etc, but main goal is:
datacentrism

Recommended Standards - file formats, software tools (funding opportunities for standardization)


Bringing data into the research ecosystem
cataloging info about datasets - if you publish a dataset, you also need to give minimal metadata

Catalog data with identifiers and descriptive text. result:
discoverable sorts of data


Justin Sanchez
--------------

inspirational talk


Kristin Bransin (Janelia)
-------------------------

doesn't want to share raw video: 0.5 PB, 'uninterpretable'


Jennifer Buss
-------------

What about 'false publishing'?  How do we know that people won't take the data and use it for malicious purposes?

Rita: thre will be fees, as distaseful as they may seem
Justin: about 'with whom to share' - get the data to the innovators - that's the fundamental charge.
Michael: about 'with whom' - about the notion of someone misusing - it's not an issue b/c you could say the same thing about scientific papers.  important question: _what_ data should be shared?  start w/ realization that not all data are equal - can't keep all daat in all the various forms in which it exists.  choose data storage based on prediction about data's primary uses.
KB - about with whom - two stages.  STage 1: before first publication, stage 2: after.

MH - you can't keep all the data.


Wrapup
------

Need a cultural change. tenure, etc.
Nefarius uses, not such a big deal because ppl already do that with published papers.
Big questions: who pays for storage?
