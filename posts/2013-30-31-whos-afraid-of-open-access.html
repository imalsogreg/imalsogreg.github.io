<h2 id="science-magazine-fights-dirty-and-what-we-can-do-about-it">Science Magazine fights dirty <br /><small>And what we can do about it</small><br /></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org">Science</a> ran a special issue on scientific communication. Kudos - interesting topic. The first couple of titles are interesting: <em>Scientific Discourse: Buckling at the Seams</em>. And <em>The Rise of Open Access</em>, an <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/58.full">invited cartoon</a> by <a href="http://www.xkcd.com">xkcd</a> cartoonist Randall Munroe. <em>Randall, you made it!</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/site/special/scicomm/infographic.jpg">The cartoon</a> is <a href="http://xkcd.com/1110/">characteristically</a> long-format, with a timeline as the x axis with a detail inset - it takes a minute for me to decode on the computer screen. Ironically, Science had to chop it in half and lay the two halves on top of one another to make it fit in the print copy of the magazine, for an indecipherable total of <em>four</em> x-axes. Usually xkcd’s comics have some <a href="http://xkcd.com/1273/">critique</a> in them that I can agree with, or at least get a laugh from. With the growing stacks of books showing how science publication is taking off exponentially, what is the critique exactly?</p>
<p>With the next article in the special, clouds gather and the skies darken - the message becomes clear. Title: <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/60.full">Who’s Afraid of Peer Review?</a> Tagline: <em>A spoof paper concocted by Science reveals little or no scrutiny at many open-access journals.</em> Oh boy… Give it a read. I’ll summarize here - let me know if I’ve been unfair. I’ll start with the interesting points that the author wouldn’t disagree with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Science correspondent John Bohannon made up a fake paper for a sting operation, to see what its fate would be under peer review</li>
<li>Flaws were written in that should be immediately obvious to “any reviewer with more than a high-school knowledge of chemistry and the ability to understand a basic data plot”</li>
<li>Bohannon sent the paper to 304 open-access journals; more than half accepted the paper.</li>
<li>With its info-graphics, spreadsheets full of data, and <em>Science</em> name brand, the article wasn’t intended to be <em>just an editorial</em>. It claims to be investigative journalism. It sure does look like it’s trying to pass as science.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-thats-a-problem">Why that's a problem:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The author didn’t submit his faux paper to any non-open source journals. <strong>There is no control group.</strong></li>
<li>The author didn’t send his paper to <a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org">PLOS Medicine</a>, <a href="http://www.plosbiology.org">PLOS Biology</a>, or <a href="http://www.elifesciences.org">eLife</a> - by far the most most popular open-access journals. <strong>The sample is biased</strong></li>
<li>The journal most of us associate with no-matter-what paper acceptance, <a href="http://www.plosone.org">PLoS One</a>, did get the paper, found flaws, and rejected it. The paper was sent to one <a href="http://www.frontiersin.org">Frontiers</a> journal, which also rejected the paper. This fact is buried deep in the article and apparently has no impact on its stated take-home message.</li>
<li>The author never mentions that he neglected the most published and most read journals - a pretty important omission! He doesn’t mention the possibility of predatory pay-wall journals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bohannon, who claims to be aware of flaws obvious to high-school chemistry students, is mysteriously unaware of the flaws in his <em>actual</em> paper - a paper that claims to be pulling the curtain back on a Wild West of open access publishing. He put the <a href="http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v10/n11/full/nmeth.2699.html">narrative of his story before the actual data</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org">Science</a> knew what it was doing here. By no fault of their own, they are historically locked to a business model that don’t make a ton of sense in the post-print age. There is going to be tension as the journal reports on a phenomenon that may lead to the end of paid-subscription science communication.</p>
<p>But that' no excuse. As they say, “always punch up, never punch down”. Punching down isn’t fair if you’re the gorilla in the room. Are Science and Bohannon punching down unfairly? Are they talking about the same open-access movement that we scientists think of when we think of Open Access? Or are they intentionally using “predatory publishers” and “open access” interchangeably in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt">FUD</a> campaign? Here is Bohannon's brief outline of open-access’ history:</p>
<blockquote>
From humble and idealistic beginnings a decade ago, open-access scientific journals have mushroomed into a global industry, driven by author publication fees rather than traditional subscriptions. Most of the players are murky. The identity and location of the journals’ editors, as well as the financial workings of their publishers, are often purposefully obscured. But Science’s investigation casts a powerful light.

</blockquote>
<p>I think we have ourselves a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumpers_and_splitters">lumper</a> here.</p>
<p>Please check out Michael Eisen’s <a href="http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/?p=1439">post</a> on this, he makes the great point: the absurdly flawed NASA study about Arsenic-loving bacteria, a paper unanimously objected to by microbiologists of every persuasion, was published by none other than Science. Jeez.</p>
<p>I am reaffirmed in my position. Send papers to publishers who are on the right side of history. I believe there is a place for Science, even for paid subscriptions to Science. That place is writing the excellent (present company excluded) News &amp; Views, editorial, and review pieces that they run. But for scientist-to-scientist communication, don't use the last-generation's forum - use the new stuff that supports peer review reform, inline commenting, and open access. There are exciting new tools on the horizon that have to do with primary papers, and they just don't work though the pay wall.</p>
