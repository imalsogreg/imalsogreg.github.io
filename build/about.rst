`Greg + Blog = Webglog`
-----------------------


I'm currently a grad student at MIT in the `Wilson Lab`__. I hope to finish up and graduate soon!

A few things really get me going:

1. Recording `lots of neurons`__ in freely moving and freely dreaming rats. 
2. Science communication, research ethics, outreach, teaching
3. `Haskell`__ programming, and that wonderful community (e.g. but not limited to `reddit`__)
4. Open source code, open access science
