In late 2013 I wrote a [refutation](TODO github link) of Steve Ramirez, Xu Liu, and Susumu Tonegawa's paper on false memory implantation. The gist of my concerns were that, with the design of the experiment, a positive result would be so much more interesting than the null result that bias in the execution of the experiment and the interpretation was inevitabel; and in fact the Steve, Xu, and Susumu did succumb to this temptation.

But the authors ran so many controls, right? The relationship between the light pulses and the freezing was so strong - the freezing on exposure to the non-shocked context was so clear.  What's the problem?

The problem is that there are lots of ways for light to cause freezing other than the authors' preferred interpretation: that they implanted a false memory. And that these alternatives were known by the authors, and casually dismissed. The complaints were shared by a quiet majority of the department - "Isn't this just a case of vanilla Pavlovian conditioning?" And, "how can they claim that they reactivated a memory engram, when they haven't even recorded and analyzed the neurons thought to process the memory?"

These aren't small issues, I said, because the difference between reactivating the engram is very, very important. How is it important? Because the difference between engram reactivation and the myriad alternatives ignored by the authors - is the difference between the slow and steady progress of science, and a world where unlocking the secrets of limitless memory, immortality, and Matrix-like skill uploading are right around the corner.

Michio Kaku's promise:  Kung-Fu Upload is right around the corner

John (TODO Spelling) Stuart is a smart guy. But like most poeple, he's not a neuroscientists, so he has to have some trust in scientists if he's to figure out what neuroscience has in store for us. Here is Michio Kaku, scientist, telling John (TODO spelling) what we can expect in the next 50 years.  ld;dr -
