How many creationists swayed toward evolution?
How many mainstream Christians swayed toward YE creationism?

Ham: comfortable, more inspirational
Nye: uncomfortable, more than a couple awkward jokes.

Nye: Show me _one_ fossil that swam from one layer of the fossil record to another layer, and you will change the world!  Science will embrace you.
Ham: They found 45,000 yo wood in the same stratum with 45,000,000 year old basalt.
Nye: Ok, in that case, the basalt probably slid on top of the wood.
Ham: It was embedded inside the basalt.

Ham: Here are videos of several well-published psysicists and engineers who are also young-earth creationists.  They are pushing technology forward.  At the same time they find no evidence for millions-of-years-old universe in their respective fields.
Nye: If we're going to continue thriving as a country, we have to have people who believe in science and technology.
Ham: Maxwell was a Christion.  Inventor of the fMRI is a young earth creationist.
Nye: Who here has a cellphone that doesn't also have a camera in it.  Who get e-mails, uses medicine, or even eats food?
Ham: I get emails and have a cameraphone.  I love technology and science.  In fact I would say you need God, to do good science.

Ham: Evolutionists are being bad scientists by extrapolating too far into the past.  We can study how the world is now, and make observations about how the world is now.  But claims about the age of the earth rest on assumptions that the laws of nature (speed of radioactive decay, the way ice layers form, the way tree rings accumulate, etc.) have remained constant since the beginning. Blindly following those assumptions is what makes evolution science its own kind of religion.
Moderator to Nye: What evidence is there, besides radiological evidence, that the earth is more than 6000 years old?
Nye: ... Well the radiological evidence is pretty good evidence!  The idea that the laws of nature can change is unscientific and based on faith.
