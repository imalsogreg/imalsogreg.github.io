Bill Nye lost the evolution vs. creationism debate against Ken Ham, handily.  The internet consensus seems to be that Ken Ham won the debate before it even started, simply by proposing the debate and landing Nye in a catch-22: attend and give the Creation Museum a huge amount of free publicity, or decline and let Ham cry censorship.  And most seem to think he should have taken the latter option.  The case for this was made nicely by Michael Schulson at [the Daily Beast](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/02/05/the-bill-nye-ken-ham-debate-was-a-nightmare-for-science.html).  At any rate, Ham won the debate *at* the debate, too.  Here's how:

  1. Ken Ham has the X factor.

He was completely at ease during the vast majority of the debate.  He didn't stumble over his words.  He was clearly very well informed and spoke intelligently.  His thoughts and delivery were organized, throughout the prepared and the improvised portions of the debate.

Although Bill Nye had a couple of stirring moments, you had to be very patient to find them.  Most of the time, he presented a mishmash of incoherent science factoids which he asserted are incompatible with creatonism, without explaining how.  Most of these probably could have been turned into valid points that Ham would have trouble addressing.  Instead, Ham ignored them.  Ham didn't say, "I won't dignify that with a response," because he didn't have to.  There simply didn't seem to be a clear idea for him to respond *to*.

 2. Bill Nye came across rigid and dogmatic, while Ken Ham turned his own dogma into into candor.

Nye repeatedly stressed that the country will be less economically competitive, if we allow the teaching of creationism in schools.  But before Nye made this statement, Ham had already rolled out a laundry list of published scientists in various fields, who also happen to be creationists.  Some space telescope engineers, coinventor of the MRI scanner, and (kind of a show-stopper, though I imagine it's contoversial to claim him for the creationism camp) James Clerk Maxwell.

Nye reiterated the point, without citing any evidence, repeatedly, as though it were an inescapable part of his pre-written notes, even though he had no response for Ham's list.

Ham let this happen a couple of times, before reiterating his previous point: Nye never made it clear how creationism will impede tech development, and he unveiled more slides with video quotes of creationists doing productive work in fields both inside and outside of biology.  Then, rather than flagrantly spiking the football and doing a victory dance, Ham delicately let this bit of awkwardness float in front of the audience without emphasis or malace. Much as I wanted Nye to win the debate, this was a pretty impressive thing to see.

Beleagured atheists following into the third hour of the debate may been rejuvinated at 2:04:09 when an audience member's question came to Ham: "What, if anything would change your mind?" This gave Ham a several-second pause, and then, "The answer is... I'm a Christian. ... The bible is the word of God, and that's where I start from."

BINGO, debate over!  Right?  Well, maybe not.  Of course scientists start from objectivity and eschew bias, and we tend to think that a hypothesis is only valuable if it's falsibiable.  First, not everyone comes from there - this is the crux of the notion of Faith.  Ham went on to say that he starts from faith, but has since been lead on by scientific facts, which far as he as found, never contradict his faith - only extrapolations from scientists into the past contradict his faith.  Second, it's very easy to turn around and convincingly question the objectivity of scientists.  Ask your standard biologist if they believe in the Big Bang, the answer will be "yes of course", and with the right probing it will usually lead to the admission of something akin to faith (or at least, an appeal to intellectual authority) from the biologist.

 3. Ham understood both sides of the debate, and both camps of people, very well. Nye only knew one.

If you think that noone who truly understands biology could come to the conclusion of creationism, just try to suspend disbelief long enough to finish reading my post.

Bill Nye was clearly familiar with the things biologists say to each other about the self-evident correctness of evolution as a theory,  e.g. - 'God, don't they know that science is all about making predictions?  And there isn't a single fossil in the fossil record that has turned up in the wrong stratum!'  He unleashed these missiles on Ken Ham. And a couple times, he seemed to realize, mid-sentence, that his points weren't scoring the kind of damage they had done in simulation - causing Nye to end on some empty note to the effect of, 'it just doesn't make sense to me, as a... reasonable person, how you could think that.'

In response to the question of there being no out-of-order fossils in the fossil record, of course Ham had a damning counterexample in mind.  He even had a powerpoint slide for it: a radiodated 45 thousand year old wood sample in very close proximity to 45 million year old basalt rock.  When Nye (who hadn't been confronted with this counterexample before) suggested that maybe the basalt slid next to the wood through normal geological processes, Ham quickly corrected him: the wood was actually encased inside the basalt.

Nye made an odd comment, twice (once well before this basalt exchange, and, odly, once again after).  He said - "You never, ever, find a higher animal mixed in with a lower one. ... If you can find one example ... the scientists of the world would embrace you - you would be a hero - you would change the world if you could find one example of that anywhere."

Needless to say Nye didn't declare Ham a hero for Ham's out-of-place wood and rock sample.  And Ham didn't hint that Nye should, although he could have; Nye made the rules very clear.  I have to say - Ham was... classy.


Lots of people are making the case that the debate should never have happened - that for a scientist to debate a creationist is to legitimize a fringe group that will fight dirty in debates and refuse to be reasoned with.

I disagree. Strongly.  First, what does it sound like to your run-of-the-mill creationist, when scientist refuses to debate on the grounds that your view should not be legitimized? What would Ken Ham say about the origins debate, if Nye refused the debate?  Something like "In many ways aggressive atheists have shut down that discussion."  He would be mostly right, except that it's not just aggressive atheists, it's the whole scientific party line!

[Here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/05/americans-believe-in-creationism_n_1571127.html) is some data on this.  Young earth creationism is the preferred origns story of 40-50% of Americans; another 30-40% prefer theistic evolution.  *We* are the fringe, easy to forget though it may be while working in a lab and having mostly science friends!  Even if you combine atheistic evolution with theistic evolution, at best the country is split down the middle.  We should figure out what it is, exactly, that makes us so alergic to the idea of defending our positions in these kinds of public forums.

True, we will never convert the true-believers.  But there are a lot of people (like children, in southern public schools), who have yet to make up their mind.
