title: Goodbye LinkedIn

I just reset my LinkedIn password, and they e-mailed all of my classmates about it. Why? Because the site confused a mailing list I'm subscribed to for my e-mail address. ...wat?

LinkedIn <strong>will</strong> scrape your e-mails, and they <strong>will</strong> screw up with security. Isolated mistake? No - they really just don't find security very interesting.

This [New York Times article](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/24/linkedins-new-mobile-app-called-a-dream-for-attackers/) pretty much sums up their philosophy. They want you to click the 'Cool Feature' button, which quietly lets them keep a copy of all your e-mail on their servers. To, you know... help you network.

I'm cancelling my LinkedIn account today. If you want to see what I'm working on, follow me on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/imalsogreg), [google plus](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+GregHale/posts), or [github](http://www.github.com/ImAlsoGreg) . These companies (github excluded) also have conflicting interests on privacy, but at least they get the damn technology right! I will just have to live without my "verified Microsoft Word" badge. Think I'll survive. :)
